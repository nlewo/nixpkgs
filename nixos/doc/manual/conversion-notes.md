# Notes on the conversion to ReST (with Sphinx extensions)
## Intro

This is an experiment to convert the NixOS manual to
[ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)
with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) extensions.

To convert DocBook files to ReST, I tried Pandoc but a lot of
directives were removed. The Sphinx documentation points to a [Python
script](https://github.com/wojdyr/db2rst) to convert a DocBook
document to a ReST (with Sphinx extensions) document by using lxml.

The Sphinx (the tool to generate the doc) closure size is currently
177MB.

## Quick start

To locally generate the manual:

    firefox $(nix-build -I 'nixpkgs=https://github.com/nlewo/nixpkgs/archive/manualFromReST.tar.gz' -E 'with import <nixpkgs/nixos/release.nix> {}; manualReSTHTML.x86_64-linux')/html/index.html`


## Provided ressources

-   The nixpkgs branch to build the manual:
    <https://github.com/nlewo/nixpkgs/tree/manualFromReST>
    -   to build the manual:
        `nix-build nixos/release.nix -A manualReSTHTML.x86<sub>64</sub>-linux`
-   The rendered manual: <https://tmp.abesis.fr/manual/rst/html>
-   The generated ReST files:
    <https://github.com/nlewo/nixpkgs/tree/manualFromReST/nixos/doc/manual-rst>
-   The python script fork to support our DocBook manual:
    <https://github.com/nlewo/db2rst>

## The good

-   ReST is simple
-   ReST is rendered by GitHub: for trivial documentation upgrade, a
    reviewer doesn't need to generate it since the GitHub preview
    would be sufficient.
-   Sphinx detects some inconsistencies in the document
-   Sphinx is written in Python which is a language already used by
    the community (the new NixOS module system)
-   Manpages can be written in ReST and are generated by Sphinx
-   Sphinx can generate XML for the next documentation conversion;)
    (needs to be explored)
-   A Sphinx extension to generate the documentation of our lib by
    extracting it from source code (needs to be explored)
-   Emacs ReST mode works well by default

## Improvements

-   Implement a Sphinx cache: it takes about 5min (ReST conversion +
    HTML generation) to generate the documentation with all NixOS
    options. By only considering the 100 first options, it takes
    15sec. It would then be nice to generate a kind of cache for the
    option documentation in order to speedup build time of the hand
    written part to make contributions more convenient. Note I don't
    know if it is possible.
-   Improve the ReST output: I didn't take time to improve the
    outputed ReST format. For instance, paragraph are not well
    truncated at 80 characters.
-   DocBook callouts: these are not supported


## Conclusions

I think ReST+Sphinx works pretty well (note I didn't know them before
starting this experimentation). I like how ReST is easy to read and
write and I didn't notice any issues with Sphinx.

And after spending several hours comparing DocBook and ReST files, I'm
sure about one thing: we should switch to this kind of language!
